        <h2>About the Course</h2>
        <p>
            Teamwork is essential for the success of any project in the workplace.<br>
             Working well with clients, managers, colleagues and other business stakeholders requires you to have certain skills. <br>
             Employers prefer candidates with these skills because they maintain a strong work culture and help the company achieve its goals.<br>
             Is teamwork a skill can be answered as, it is a virtue that you can develop through regular practice.<br> 
             It refers to your ability to work well with others to achieve a common goal. <br>
             A team player would always prioritise the goals of their team over individual interests.<br>
            This soft skill allows you to work as a team during conversations, professional collaborations and meetings.<br>
            In fact, teamwork is one of the most sought-after skills for almost every profession. <br>
             That is why employers often look for keywords like "team player" or "teamwork" on a candidate's resume.<br>
             Teamwork Skills Examples<br>
             Teamwork skills are a combination of soft skills that employees use to work together and achieve a common goal. Here are some important teamwork skills employers look for in a candidate:<br>        
            <strong>communication</strong><br>
The ability to communicate and express ideas clearly and concisely is a vital teamwork skill. <br>
Regardless of whether you communicate in person, via email, phone and instant messages, good communications skills help you share relevant ideas, thoughts and key information with other team members.
 Effective communication relies on factors such as listening actively, asking questions when required, showing respect, being friendly and maintaining good body language.<br>
 <strong>Conflict Management</strong> 
 A critical teamwork skill is the ability to mediate conflicts between team members. Employers prefer candidates with strong conflict management skills because such employees can handle conflicts with efficiency and fairness. 
 When resolving conflicts, an efficient team player would try to reduce workplace tension and foster communication between the conflicting team members to improve the team's productivity.<br>
 <strong>Active listening</strong>
 Active listening skills help team members to trust and understand each other. 
 The ability to listen to your team members can help you understand what they are trying to communicate.
  When you focus intently on someone as they share their ideas, thoughts or feelings, it shows them that you care about their viewpoint.
  Responsibility
Within the dynamic of teamwork, it is important that the parties involved both understand the work they are responsible for and make the effort to complete said tasks on time and up to the expected standard. With the entire team functioning properly by taking responsibility for their own work, they can work together towards a common goal.
Honesty
Being honest and transparent is a critical teamwork skill because it requires you to share difficult updates, such as the inability to complete a certain task on time. Employers prefer candidates who can admit their mistakes and fulfil their commitments because it helps a team function properly. Without transparency, it can be difficult for a team to develop trust and therefore work together efficiently.
Adaptability
For a team to work together, every team member requires to complete whatever role they are assigned. Adapting to the work environment and working outside your comfort zone is a desirable teamwork skill. For instance, you may feel comfortable working on a social media platform. However, if your manager delegates your task to someone else because they require your help with a new email platform, you are required to accept your new role gracefully and work on the newly assigned task instead of complaining about the change.
