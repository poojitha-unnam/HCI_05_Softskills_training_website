        <h2>About the Course</h2>
        <p>
            Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique to train attention and awareness and detach from reflexive, "discursive thinking," achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state, while not judging the meditation process itself.
        </p>
        <h2>Course Topics</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Introduction to Time Management</strong><br>
            Meditation is to help people cope better with stress, anxiety, and other negative states of mind. We want to build a more mindful world!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Mindfulness of Breathing</strong><br>
            By focusing on the breath you become aware of the mind’s tendency to jump from one thing to another. The simple discipline of concentration brings us back to the present moment and all the richness of experience that it contains. It is a way to develop mindfulness, the faculty of alert and sensitive awareness. And it is an excellent method for cultivating the states of intense meditative absorption known as dhyana. As well as this, the mindfulness of breathing is a good antidote to restlessness and anxiety, and a good way to relax: concentration on the breath has a positive effect on your entire physical and mental state.

            The meditation has four progressive stages leading to a highly enjoyable level of concentration. To start with five minutes per stage is a good period of practice.
            
            1. In the first stage you use counting to stay focused on the breath. After the out-breath you count one, then you breathe in and out and count two, and so on up to ten, and then you start again at one.
            
            2. In the second stage you subtly shift where you breathe, counting before the in-breath, anticipating the breath that is coming, but still counting from one to ten, and then starting again at one.
            
            3. In the third stage you drop the counting and just watch the breath as it comes in and goes out.
            
            4. In the final stage the focus of concentration narrows and sharpens, so you pay attention to the subtle sensation on the tip of the nose where the breath first enters and last leaves the body.

            <strong>3. Body Awareness Meditation</strong><br>
            Step One: Awareness of the Body
            Focus on relaxing the body, letting go of any tension, in the five-stage sequence below.
            
            Step One: Awareness of the Body as a whole:
            
            Relax the head, face, jaw, and neck.
            Relax the shoulders, arms, and hands.
            Relax the chest and abdomen.
            Relax the back.
            Relax the legs.
            Go on to the next step.
            
            Step Two: Breathing Awareness of the Organs:
            
            Imagine the internal body in five parts (lung, heart, liver, pancreas, and kidneys) as shown in the illustration above. Then visualize using the breath to relax the five internal organs pictured above.
            
            1. Breathe 3 breaths into your visualization of the heart. Imagine the heart relaxing with each exhalation.
            2. Breathe 6 breaths into your visualization of the lungs. Imagine the lungs relaxing.
            3. Breathe 9 breaths into your visualization of the liver. Imagine the liver relaxing.
            4. Breathe 9 breaths into your visualization of the pancreas. Imagine the pancreas relaxing.
            5. Breathe 9 breaths into your visualization of the kidneys. Imagine the kidneys relaxing.
            Return to the Awareness of the Body as a whole and repeat twice more.
            
            After 3 repetitions, sit in stillness for a few seconds or minutes and enjoy the calm.
        </p>

            <strong>4. Board Mindfulness Meditation</strong><br>
            Meditation can be defined in many ways. But a simple way to think of it is training your attention to achieve a mental state of calm concentration and positive emotions.

            Mindfulness is one of the most popular meditation techniques. It has two main parts: attention and acceptance.
            
            The attention piece is about tuning into your experiences to focus on what's happening in the present moment. It typically involves directing your awareness to your breath, your thoughts, the physical sensations in your body, and the feelings you are experiencing. The acceptance piece involves observing those feelings and sensations without judgment. Instead of responding or reacting to those thoughts or feelings, you aim to note them and let them go.
            
            How to get started:
            Ready to give it a try? Learning mindfulness is easier than ever. Mindfulness classes and interventions are widely available in settings including yoga centers, athletic clubs, hospitals, and clinics, though the classes can vary in their approach. Find a therapist trained in MBSR or MBCT — interventions that have the most evidence of benefits.
            
            A number of mindfulness-based interventions are now available online or through smartphone apps as well, although more long-term research is needed to explore how they affect the body and the brain. Still, early studies have found that online mindfulness-based interventions can have a positive effect on mental health.
            
            It can take a little while for mindfulness meditation to feel natural and to become a part of your regular routine. But with practice, you may discover a powerful tool for relieving stress and improving well-being.
